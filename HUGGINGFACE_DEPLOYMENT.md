# 🤗 HuggingFace Spaces Deployment Guide

## 🚀 One-Click Deployment

The pup-sdk is now **fully HuggingFace Spaces ready**! Here's how to deploy:

### **Option 1: GitHub Integration (Easiest)**

1. **Go to HuggingFace Spaces**: https://huggingface.co/spaces
2. **Click "Create new Space"**
3. **Choose "Git"** and connect your GitHub account
4. **Select the `AlbertoRoca-web/pup-sdk` repository**
5. **Set Space name** (e.g., "alberto-code-puppy")
6. **Choose Python as SDK**
7. **Cost: Free CPU** (or upgrade for more power)
8. **Click "Create Space"**

**That's it! 🎉** Your Space will automatically build and deploy!

### **Option 2: Manual Deployment**

1. Clone the repo to your Space:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlbertoRoca-web/pup-sdk .
```

2. The Space will automatically detect `app.py` and `requirements.txt`
3. Wait for build to complete
4. Your Alberto web interface will be live!

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### **Environment Variables**

In your Space settings, you can configure:

```
ALBERTO_API_URL=http://localhost:8080    # Where Alberto bridge server runs
ALBERTO_API_KEY=                        # Optional API key
ALBERTO_TIMEOUT=60                      # Request timeout
HOST=0.0.0.0                           # Network interface
PORT=7860                              # Port (HuggingFace sets this automatically)
DEBUG=false                            # Production mode
LOG_LEVEL=info                         # Logging verbosity
```

### **Connecting to Real Alberto**

Your Space will work **immediately in demo mode**. To connect to the real Alberto:

1. **Run the bridge server** somewhere (could be your local machine or cloud):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlbertoRoca-web/pup-sdk
cd pup-sdk
python bridge_server.py
```

2. **Set the ALBERTO_API_URL** in your Space settings to point to your bridge server
3. **Restart your Space** to connect!
